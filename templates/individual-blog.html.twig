                                We have had an interesting few days in front of our house at Malalane Gate this week… It involves a dead impala, 
                                a very rare bird of prey and our local predator/scavenger friends; A “kill” in front of the house. I was in the kitchen 
                                getting breakfast ready for Alex and Jack when I spotted a strange shape on the ground in front of our yard. I pointed 
                                it out to Steven. “Were the elephants here last night, my love?” Thinking it was either a big heap of elephant dung, 
                                “Or is that a dead impala?”Steven got his binoculars out. It was, indeed a dead impala. We could not figure out what 
                                killed the poor antelope or how it died… I bit of a mystery if you ask me. What was also weird is that there was no 
                                predator around. It was still very early in the morning and I expected the hyenas that do the rounds around the staff 
                                village here to come and scoop it up any second. But no one did and by the time we left for school, the bokkie was 
                                still there. Steven and I spent ages looking out the window, expecting a leopard or a hyena to come and take advantage 
                                of this ‘kill’ in front of the house. Of course, we did not want to miss the action!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Not a single animal paid attention to the dead impala all day. Other impalas passed by without so much as looking at their 
                                deceased friend. Kudu’s walked past without noticing it, even our local family of warthogs was not interested. I slept 
                                with the curtains open that night. Hoping that a perceptive leopard or lion would trigger the motion sensor light on our 
                                front gate. I hardly slept in anticipation, but the next morning, the ‘kill’ in front of the house was still there. Untouched. 
                                And the morning after that. And the morning after that. It was the weirdest thing!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We could for the life of us not figure out why not a single animal wanted to eat this impala. Were the predators/scavengers 
                                just not around? Or were they around, but was the dead impala in front of our house too close to human hustle and bustle? 
                                Alex and Jack were also fascinated. Every afternoon when I picked them up from school, they asked me of the bokkie was still 
                                there. Eventually, on the fourth morning, we woke up to a lone vulture sitting in our heart-shaped tree. And not just any 
                                vulture: A very rare and endangered White-Headed Vulture! How cool is that? I have never seen one and now it just presented 
                                itself right in front of our home!

                                        We could for the life of us not figure out why not a single animal wanted to eat this impala. Were the predators/scavengers just not 
                                        around? Or were they around, but was the dead impala in front of our house too close to human hustle and bustle? Alex and Jack were 
                                        also fascinated. Every afternoon when I picked them up from school, they asked me of the bokkie was still there.
